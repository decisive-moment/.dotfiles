To do:

Add setings for speeding up mac animations
Taken from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/pqbrrg/how_to_speed_up_animations_in_macos/

My Terminal/command line setup for new Macs to improve perceived speed as follows:

defaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true

disables all Finder animations. Relaunch Finder afterwards via Command-Option-Escape.

defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-show-duration -float .1

defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-hide-duration -float .1

speeds up the Launchpad show/hide animation (you can modify the float values to your liking, a value of 0 disables the animation).

defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-page-duration -float .2

speeds up the Launchpad "page-flip" animation.

Again, you can modify the float value to your liking, 0 disables the animation. For this, you have to relaunch the Dock afterwards via Terminal: killall dock.

You can reverse all modifications by replacing the defaults write command with defaults delete and omitting the value after the key. E.g.

defaults delete com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations
